The program is trying to determine which payment option is better(more money).
Fist option is 100 dollars per day for 10 days. The second option is 1 dollar
a day with it beiing doubled each day for 10 days. There will be two functions to calculate the pay rate.
function 1 will calculate the amount for the first option, function 2 will calculate the amount for the second options.

function1 will output 100 * 10 days.
function 2 will loop 10 times, with each time, doubling the amount and add the amount to the total 

if the amount is equal, we output tp the user option 1 and option 2 pays the same
if option 1 is better, we output option 1 is better 
if option 1 is better, we output option 1 is better
